# üìç Team Doonav @ Snapchat AWE 2025 Hackathon

Welcome to Doonav‚Äôs submission for the **Snapchat AWE 2025 Hackathon**.

We're using this opportunity to explore the power of **location-based storytelling in augmented reality**, with a specific focus on **co-located experiences using Snap Spectacles** and Snap‚Äôs AR ecosystem.

## üåç Our Vision

Doonav is made up of the team at Imvizar, where we believe the future of storytelling is spatial and place-aware. Augmented reality unlocks a new narrative medium, one where stories are tied not just to time and character, but to *location*. With Snap‚Äôs tools, we‚Äôre able to create experiences that respond to where the user is, what they see, and how they move.

## üß† How Easy Is It to Build a Location-Based Co-Located Experience with Snap Spectacles?

We approached this question in 3 steps:

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Accessibility, How Easy Is It to Build?
Snap‚Äôs tooling (especially Lens Studio and VPS) makes prototyping *incredibly fast*. We ported Unity projects into Snap‚Äôs environment with minimal friction, and the asset pipeline is smooth and creator-friendly. Surface tracking and VPS unlock reliable anchoring, even in complex urban spaces.

### üéØ Step 2: Refining UX with the 5 Principles of Spatial Storytelling
We applied and iterated based on these five foundational principles:

1. **Place** - Contextually anchor stories to real-world environments.
2. **Virtual Content** - Use stylized assets to complement, not compete with, reality.
3. **User Movement** - Encourage walking and shifting perspective.
4. **Interactivity** - Let users trigger, manipulate, or reveal parts of the story.
5. **Sound** - Use spatial audio to deepen immersion and guide attention.

### ü§ù Step 3: Adding the 6th Principle, **Shared Experience**
True co-location is social. By designing for **multiple users in the same space**, we explored how story moments can sync across people, reinforcing connection, awareness, and narrative alignment. Snap‚Äôs VPS helps make this technically possible and narratively compelling.
